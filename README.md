# VISTA

This repository contains the computer vision module for a research project aiming to create a system capable of autonomous robotic assembly through AI-based computer visionâ€‹. While the main repository for this project is private, this repo contains the portion of work that I led and developed.

VISTA (Vision-based Intelligent System for Task-based Assembly) is a system that includes vision-based object segmentation, and real-time quality control, enabling autonomous robotic pick-and-place operations. The system utilizes CNN models and OpenCV-based processing to interpret vision data for robotic decision-making.
